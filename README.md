## 🚀 About Me

- **Mechatronics Engineer**: I blend mechanical, electronic, and software engineering to create innovative solutions.
- **Data Scientist**: I love working with data to uncover insights and build models.
- **Python Coder**: I mainly use Python and have experience with PyTorch for deep learning.
- **SQL Knowledge**: I’m skilled in SQL for managing and querying data.
- **Visualization Enthusiast**: I’m currently into practicing visualization tools like tableau and power-bi.

## 💻 My Workstation

I prefer working in a Linux environment, where I can accomplish tasks using just one terminal. I enjoy **bash scripting** to automate boring tasks, making my workflow more efficient and enjoyable.

## 🚗 My Startup Journey

I run a **4-year-old startup** focused on manufacturing electric automobiles. As the sole technical person, I design and fabricate prototypes that are robust and reliable for Indian roads. Currently, the startup is self-funded, with all prototypes developed using my pocket money or through freelancing for software-related roles. 

## 💡 My Approach

I strive to understand what a person truly needs and aim to deliver solutions that closely align with their imagination. I believe that effective communication and empathy are key to creating impactful results. Like Deadpool, I might take unconventional paths to solve problems, but I always get the job done!

## 🌱 Exploring New Ideas

I’m excited about finding ways to connect Mechatronics with Data Science. I believe there’s a lot of potential to create something beautiful by combining these fields.
