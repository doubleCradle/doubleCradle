# Hi there, I'm Aman! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Mechatronics Engineer who recently ventured into the world of Data Science. My passion lies in building stuff that other people can use with joy.

MAXIMUM EFFORT

### 🚗 My Startup Journey

I run a **4-year-old startup** focused on manufacturing electric automobiles. As the sole technical person, I design and fabricate prototypes that are robust and reliable for Indian roads. Currently, the startup is self-funded, with all prototypes developed using my pocket money or through freelancing for software-related roles. 

### 💡 My Approach

I strive to understand what a person truly needs and aim to deliver solutions that closely align with their imagination. I believe that effective communication and empathy are key to creating impactful results. Like Deadpool, I might take unconventional paths to solve problems, but I always get the job done!"Maximum Effort!"

### 🌱 Exploring New Ideas

I’m excited about finding ways to connect Mechatronics with Data Science. I believe there’s a lot of potential to create something beautiful by combining these fields.
